## Why?

Nowadays, we have commander.js and all the other cli tools to choose, but why we build **yet another cli tool** ? 

In the real-world scenario, nested commands are so popular among large-scale projects. Pero is trying to solve this problem and also bring you with the progressive TypeScript support. 


## Feature

- Route based, born to create nested CLI commands
- ESBuild driven, really fast to compile your CLI project

## Quick Tour

**This project is under heavy development, APIs might be changed until the stable version is released. [📍Roadmap](https://github.com/h-a-n-a/pero/issues/1)**

### 1. Install

```bash
npm install pero --save
# or use
yarn add pero
```


### 2. Create a folder for CLI

```bash
mkdir src
cd $_ 
touch index.ts # or index.js
```

In the example above, `index.ts` is created in the root of the CLI source folder `src`, 
which is defined as the top-most command in CLI. 

```
.
└── src
    └── index.ts
```


### 3. `vim index.ts`

Add the code and finish your first Pero app!

```typescript
import { Command, Args } from 'pero'

export default (command: Command) => {
  // command registration: define your command here
  command
    .argument('[something]', 'your-description')
    .option('-e', 'environment')

  // action
  return (args: Args) => {
    // do something with user-input args here
    
    command.help() // print help message
  }
}
```

In Pero, we have to two steps in our runtime:

- Step1: Registration, in the outer callback we have `command` passed as the first param, you can utilize this to define your command's arguments or options. 
- Step2: Action, in the inner callback we have `args` passed to, you may do something with user-input args 


### 4. Compile and run

```bash
npx pero src --name "name-your-cli"
```

Your CLI will be emitted to `dist`

Run the code below, you will get the corresponding help message in the terminal.

```bash
node ./dist/pero.js
```


## Advanced Usage


### Nested Command

With the demo project introduced in the Quick Tour section, try to add a new folder under `src` folder,
you will get the nested command right away! This is really cool.

```
.
└── src
    ├── build ## the sub-command we added
    │    └── index.ts
    └── index.ts
```

To trigger the sub-command `build`, do the compilation first and run:

```bash
node ./dist/index.js build
```

You will see anything in the sub-command's action printed to the screen. Great!
